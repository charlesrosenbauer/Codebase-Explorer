# Codebase Explorer
---

Got a new, daunting codebase you need to work on?

This program will create a semantic map of the code that you can explore and visualize.

This should work on any programming language you have, provided the code uses ASCII for identifiers (sorry international users, feel free to contribute Unicode additions).
